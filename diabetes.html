                <h5 class="card-title">Diabetes</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin. There are two main types: Type 1, where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells, and Type 2, which is more common and linked to lifestyle factors and genetics. Symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred vision. Long-term complications can affect the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. Management involves lifestyle changes, monitoring blood sugar levels, and medications or insulin therapy.</p>
