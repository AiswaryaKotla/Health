                <h5 class="card-title">Cardiovascular Diseases</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) refer to a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure, and stroke. These conditions often result from atherosclerosis, where plaque builds up in the arteries, leading to reduced blood flow. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle. Symptoms can vary but may include chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue. Preventive measures and treatments involve lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgical interventions to manage symptoms and reduce risks.</p>
