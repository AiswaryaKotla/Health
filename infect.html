                <p class="card-text">Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, and can spread directly or indirectly from person to person. Common examples include tuberculosis, influenza, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. These diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, from mild to severe, including fever, fatigue, and organ-specific issues. Prevention and control involve vaccination, good hygiene practices, safe food and water, and vector control. Effective treatment depends on the specific pathogen and may include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, or antiparasitic medications.</p>
