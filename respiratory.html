                <p class="card-text">Respiratory diseases encompass a range of conditions affecting the lungs and airways, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia. These diseases can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness. They may be triggered or exacerbated by factors like air pollution, smoking, infections, and allergens. Chronic respiratory conditions often require long-term management through medications, lifestyle changes, and avoiding triggers. Effective treatment and preventive measures can improve quality of life and reduce the severity of symptoms.</p>
