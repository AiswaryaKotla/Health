Health Awareness Web App

This is a simple web-based health awareness portal developed as part of my community service project in 2024 during my second year of college. The goal of this project is to provide essential information about major health issues and promote awareness through an interactive, user-friendly website.

Features:
- Login authentication (demo: `admin` / `password`)
- User details form to collect basic health-related data
- Informative pages on major diseases:
  - Diabetes
  - Cardiovascular Diseases
  - Infectious Diseases
  - Respiratory Diseases


Pages Included:
 | File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `index.html` | Login page |
| `Details.html` | Form to collect user information (Name, Age, Aadhar, etc.) |
| `diseases.html` | Central page to select a disease category |
| `diabetes.html` | Information about Diabetes |
| `cardio.html` | Information about Cardiovascular Diseases |
| `infect.html` | Information about Infectious Diseases |
| `style.css` | Custom styles and animations |

Some image files like `Car.jpeg`, `Diabetes.jpeg`, `Inf.jpeg`, and `Resp.jpeg` are used to visually represent each disease section.
